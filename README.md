NUMBERSUMS - by Artur Nunes de Souza - 16/09/24

This is a game, coded by myself, unsing C language. It was done as a college assignment, 
for the subject Algorithm and Computer Configuration, taught by teacher Carla Castanho.

*** INSTRUCTIONS ***

For Windows-
There are 2 ways to run the game. The first step for both  ways is to download the 4 files 
found in the project_apc folder in the NumberSums--APC directory and save them in the same 
folder on your  computer. Then, you must  double-click on the NumberSums.c file to open it, 
using your preferred IDE, and from there, you must compile and run the game (it must be working normally).

the second way is using the terminal.  If you already have all the necessary things to run
a  program made in C on  your computer, you must, in the  folder where you saved the files,
right-click on the NumberSums.c file, and then click on "Open in Terminal" button. With the
terminal open, you will use the commands "gcc NumberSums.c", and then "./a". (it must be working normally too).
